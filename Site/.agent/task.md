# Task: Update Event Countdown Logic

## Status
- [x] Update `AttendanceCard` countdown logic to show "m" for months, "d" for days, "h" for hours, "m" for minutes, and "expired" if passed. <!-- id: 0 -->
- [x] Fix time parsing to handle ranges (e.g., "20:59 - 21:59") so it doesn't show "--". <!-- id: 1 -->
